# Paste and merge data with the existing dataset

Paste merging works like a VLOOKUP in Excel, in that when you copy data into OrgVue you need to have a property common to both tables and this is the field used to merge data into OrgVue.
Check the Properties Panel in the Side Panel to check your merge was successful– the Properties Panel lets you select which properties are displayed on the Worksheet, in what order (30 max.)  

##Task: practice paste and merge using 1505 Dataset

1) Create your own 1505 Dataset using the Employee Data tab in ‘Ch2 – 6. 1505 Dataset.xlsx’ 

2) Merge the data from the ‘Hours Worked per Week’ tab with the Employee Data

Note: We will use this Dataset from chapter 2 to chapter 6.
