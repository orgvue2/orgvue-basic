**Note:** Interfaces are covered in more detail in the OrgVue Blog

##The OrgVue interfaces are suitable in different situations

|| Webforms | Surveys | Tasks |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|  | ![](2I-002.webform.png)| ![](2I-003.survey.png) | ![](2I-004.tasks.png)
| What? | Online forms that allows users to update a Dataset, requires users to have an OrgVue login| Customisable surveys that can be administered via OrgVue, can be sent to anyone - response progress is tracked  | A single URL containing several bespoke apps, requires users to have access to OrgVue|
| When to use? | Useful when you want multiple users to **update** various aspects of a Dataset without logging in to Workspace | Useful when you want to gather **one-off** information from a large number of respondents and aggregate the results| Useful when you want to guide users through a **data entry process**, especially if it involves dynamic workflow/ approval
