# Multiple Hierarchies

##Practice Overview

It is common to have multiple hierarchies in organisational data, e.g. matrix reporting. In OrgVue you can set up and view multiple hierarchies in the same organisation. The alternative hierarchies share the same primary key (e.g. “Employee ID”), but have a different parent key (e.g. “Functional Manager ID”).

In the example organisation ‘Ch3. Multiple hierarchies.xlsx’, the current reporting structure is Region-based. Let’s add additional reporting lines that are Function-based.
