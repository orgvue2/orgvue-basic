# Tree view

##Expand to level

Navigate to Tree View. We can’t see much detail in the current View. So let’s start off making things more manageable by filtering to Level 3.

Now it is much manageable. The ‘Expand to level’ dropdown lets you expand and collapse the tree to the selected Depth.

##Colour by

1) Apply colouring using the Color Control (colour by “Department”)

**The colour scheme you apply in the Side Panel applies to all views.**

2) Hovering over a department in the Side Panel will highlight that department in the Tree
