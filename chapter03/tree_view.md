# Tree view

##Expand to level

Navigate to Tree View. We can’t see much detail in the current View. So let’s start off making things more manageable by filtering to Level 3.

Now it is much manageable. The ‘Expand to level’ dropdown lets you expand and collapse the tree to the selected Depth.

##Colour by

1) Apply colouring using the Color Control (colour by “Department”)

**The colour scheme you apply in the Side Panel applies to all views.**

2) Hovering over a department in the Side Panel will highlight that department in the Tree

##Summary card

1) Open up the Card Panel in the Side Panel and choose the card type depending on the type of data you want to highlight. In this example, ‘Summary’ card has been selected. Summary card is useful when you want to display multiple properties for each node. (NB ‘Icon’ is the default card type)

2) Choose ‘Title’, ‘Subtitle’ and other properties you want to show on cards

##Scaled card

1) Now choose ‘Scaled’ card from the dropdown list

2) Choose a ‘Title’, ‘Subtitle’ and ‘Size by’ to configure the Scaled card as you want. Scaled card helps to give a sense of proportion within the familiar org chart picture

##Tree layout

OrgVue helps you represent hierarchical structures in your data in efficient and beautiful ways. Try different layouts using ‘Tree layout’ dropdown.

##Zoom in & out

OrgVue makes it easy to see as much detail as you need.

* 

**You can also move the Tree vertically and horizontally by left-clicking the screen and dragging anywhere in the canvas**


* **You can also zoom in or out using the mouse wheel**

##Change reporting structure using Drag-and-Drop

Simply Drag and Drop a node or group of nodes to make changes to your tree. 

Executive Assistant currently reports to CEO. Now you want to make Executive Assistant and all their descendants report to CFO.

1) Drag the Executive Assistant and drop onto CFO (waiting until the red ‘x’ by the cursor is gone)

2) When the ‘Confirm’ Dialogue appears, click ‘OK’ to make Executive Assistant (and their descendants) a child of CFO

3) Now Executive Assistant (and their reports) reports up through the CFO
