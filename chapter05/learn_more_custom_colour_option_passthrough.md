#Custom colour option (‘Passthrough’)

1.
To manually set the colour for each node or group of nodes, first create a new property (in the example below this is called “Custom Colour”)

2.
In that property, enter the name of popular colours, e.g. “Red”, “Blue”, “Orange”. Alternatively use hexadecimal colour codes, e.g. “#FF0000” for Red
