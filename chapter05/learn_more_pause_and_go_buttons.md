# Learn more: 'Pause' and 'Go' buttons

Make use of ‘Pause’ and ‘Go’ buttons when you redraw visualisations with a large number of nodes. Pause and Go buttons exist in the Toolbar, and the Dashboard, Properties, Card, Chart, Pivot and Expression Panels in the Side Panel.

Single click the ‘pause’ icon to suspend re-caluclation. Similarly, single click on the ‘play’ icon to trigger a re-calculation. Double click when on pause to go back to the default setting of ‘Auto-Play’

**‘Pause’ button will prevent re-rendering the data with every user interaction, leading to performance gain**
