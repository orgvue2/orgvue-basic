##Introduction

OrgVue provides standard and bespoke Dashboards depending on license type. Please see our website orgvue.com and Dashboard catalogue (request info@orgvue.com) for fuller descriptions of the available Dashboards. In this chapter, we will  go through 3 standard Dashboards you may use frequently.

You can navigate to Dashboards via the Toolbar.

2. Configure the Dashboard using the Dashboard Panel in the Side Panel. Cross-tabulate by two properties selected here – ‘Columns’ and ‘Rows’, and select an aggregation type for the values
