Tree View and related concepts will be covered in more detail in [Chapter 3].

### Change layouts 

In OrgVue, hierarchies can be visualised in various other layouts other than traditional tree-like org chart. You can change the layout from the ‘Tree layout’ dropdown list.

**Exercise:** explore couple of layout options – Tree, Horizontal Tree, Icicle, Sunburst and Balloon and discuss how it captures hierarchical relationships and why it can be useful.


### View a subset of your data
There are multiple ways of subsetting your organisation in OrgVue.

#### 1. Subset by level 
![](../chapter01pics/1-039.showlevels.png) 'Expand to level' lets you to control the level of depth you want to display. In Royal Family example, you can choose from 1 to 4. If you set it to level 2, the chart will collapse 2 levels up.
