**Note:** OrgVue users with ‘admin’ permission can access additional Tabs for account and Dataset administration.

### Home screen - Tabs
All data is held in a series of Tabs. These Tabs store files of a certain type (e.g. People, Roles), control user permissions (Users), and hold automatically generated Datasets (e.g. Links, Surveys).

![](../chapter01pics/1-005.tabs.png)
**Notes:**
* Tabs in green boxes are permanent Tabs that deal with system-level issues, such as managing Favourites, Links, Lookups, User Permissions and Surveys
* Other Tabs contain different types of Datasets and are configurable by the administrator

### Home screen – Dataset management icons

You can manage your Datasets using the icons at the top on the Home screen.
