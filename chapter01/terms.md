A file that contains data in a series of rows and columns that can be opened and analysed (similar to an Excel spreadsheet)

##### Tenant
A logically and physically-separated partition on the OrgVue server keeping your data private and secure

##### User role
The type of account you have. This is either ‘admin’ or ‘user’, though more specialised roles can defined to control what data you can and can’t see
