**Notes:**
* If you choose ‘Tree (by IDs)’, OrgVue automatically builds a hierarchy based on the selected ‘ID’ and a ‘Parent ID’. Meanwhile the ‘Flat data’ option is for the dataset not in a hierarchical structure or to display hierarchical data as a flat data.
* ‘Label’ is an identifiable descriptor for each record – can be changed later, e.g. “Name”, “Role”.
* ‘ID’ is a unique identifier for each record (node), for the employees dataset normally it is “Employee ID” or “NI Number” and etc.
* ‘Parent ID’ is a property used to define hierarchical relationships between nodes, for the employee datasets it can be “Manager ID”

|Employee ID|Manager ID|Name      |
|---------|--------|----------|
|1| |Tom|
|2|1|John|
|3|1|Ben|
|4|1|Nick|
