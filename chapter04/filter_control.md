# Filter Control

##Introduction

The Filter Control lets you apply sophisticated filters to your data throughout all active Views in OrgVue.

**From any View, you can open a Filter Control window by clicking the ‘Filter’ icon in the Toolbar**

##Apply a filter

1) You can filter your data by left-clicking once on any category in any filter column in the main window

2) Note that this filters down the number of records from 1,505 (the number of total employees) to 1,138 (the number of employees located in Manchester)

3) Notice that the number of employees under the remaining filter columns of “Gender”, “Age” and “Department” have also updated

##Apply multiple filters

The Filter Control helps you to answer complex questions, because the data within the filter is dynamically responsive.

1) We have now applied two filters simultaneously to our data – filtering by employees located in Manchester and in the Projects Department

2) The remaining values under the “Area” property Filter disappeared - this quickly tells us the entire Projects Department works only in Manchester
